# introduction to HCI

## importance of HCI

- 63% of large software projects go over costs

- managers gave four user-related reasons:
    - **users requested changes**
    - **overlooking tasks**
    - **users did not understand their own requirements**
    - **insufficient user-developer communication and understanding**

- **usability engineering is software engineering**
    - coders jump too quickly into detailed design
        - founded on incorrect requirements
        - inappropriate dialog flow
        - not easily used
        - never tested until too late

- consequences of bad designs are large
    - **costly errors** in serious systems
    - **widespread effects**
    - **life-critical** systems
    - **safety and security**

# use and context

- HCI is concerned with the **design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use** and with the study of **major phenomena surrounding them**

## history

- input and output devices
    
    
    |  | input | output |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | before | connecting wires, paper tape, punch cards | lights on a display, paper, teletype |
    | today | keyboard, cursor keys, mouse | scrolling glass teletype, character terminal, bit-mapped screen |
    | future | data gloves, suits, computer jewelry | head-mounted displays, ubiquitous computing, autonomous agents and robots |
- the way people interacted with computers
    
    
    | batch processing | interpersonal computing |
    | --- | --- |
    | timesharing | interactive computing |
    | networking | community computing |
    | graphical displays | direct manipulation |
    | microprocessors | personal computing |
    | WWW | global information |
    | ubiquitous computing/IOT | embedded software in objects to service everyday activities |
    | social robots | companions and coaches |
- **IBM type 285** tabulators for batch processing of punch cards in a stack on each machine

    - 1500 radio tubes for counters, registers, and logic operations
- IBM automatic sequence controlled calculator called **Mark I**
- **ENIAC** was the world’s second all electronic numerical integrator and computer
    - with 19000 radio tubes
- **IBM SSEC** or selective sequence electronic calculator - electromechanical computer
- **RAND corporation** home computer

### vannevar bush’s memex (memory extender)

- **conceiving hypertext and the WWW**
    - device where individuals **store all personal books, records, and communications**
    - items retrieved rapidly through **indexing, keywords, cross references**
    - can **annotate text** with margin notes and comments
    - can **construct and save a train** through the material
    - acts as an **external memory**

> HCI leads to **cost-reduction** 
HCI **avoids disasters**

## history continued

- significant advances 1960s-1980
    - **time sharing** gave the illusion of one **being on one’s own computer**
        - dramatically **increased accessibility of computers**
        - led to **immediate need for HCI**
            - **afforded interactive systems vs batch “jobs”**
- **interactions** start to happen
    - **ergonomics** (1956-63)
        - console ergonomics
        - job control languages
        - CTSS, MAC, JOSS, BASIC
