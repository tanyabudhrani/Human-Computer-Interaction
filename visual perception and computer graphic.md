# visual perception and computer graphic

# visual system

## input: perception

- visual (’iconic’)
- **image**: physical reception
    - eye receives light and **transforms it into electrical energy**
    - **light reflects from objects**; their images are focused upside down on retina

> law of visual angle:

$tan θ/2 = s/2d$
$θ = 2 arctan(s/2d)$ 
$θ s=2d tan θ/2$
> 
- **ganglion cells detect pattern and movement**
- **retina** contains **rods for low-light** vision and **cones for color vision**

### brightness

- subjective reaction to **levels of light**
- affected by **luminance of object**
- measured by just noticeable difference
- **visual acuity** increases with **luminance** as does flashing

### pattern filters

- certain neurons work as **pattern filters**
- **filters pass middle frequencies** better than higher and lower frequencies
- **mutual suppression** (random noise from individual cells is corrected by the larger group)

### color

- **hue** (based on the wavelength of light)
- **intensity** (lighter/darker)
- **saturation** (purity of the hue in a color)
    - the higher the saturation, the purer the color
- cones sensitive to color wavelengths— again, mutual suppression
    - cones for read wear out
    - cones for cyan remain firing
- **blue acuity is lowest**
- 8% males and 1% females are color blind

> color is NO property of the physics of light
color is the **human interpretation of different energetic frequencies** (short waves, long waves) that hit a cell

1. to merge two images taken from different angles, they must **enter the optic chasm**  
    - images are split where **left goes right, and right goes left**
2. but before the image can be passed on from the visual cortex to the next station, it must be **flipped, rotated, and resized**

- image: interpretation 3D
    - 3D vision is NO property of image on the retina
- **slicing up (eye fixations)**
- imputing missing data from memory (**concept-driven percept**)
- shrinking images
- taking them from different angles
- **splitting them up— lift right, right left**
- **merging, flip, rotate, resize (blow up)**

### size and depth

- **visual angle** indicates **how much of view is occupied** by the object
- related to **size and distance from eye**
- **visual acuity** is ability to **perceive fine detail**
- ‘**law of size constancy**’ means that **familiar objects are perceived as constant size** in spite of changes in visual angle
- cues like ‘**overlapping**’ help perception of size and depth

- **expanding optic flow** indicates **‘we go forward’**

- **contracting optic flow** indicates **‘backward’**

- **long retinal path** indicates **‘close by’**

- **short retinal path** indicates **‘far away’**
- **side of leaving** visual half field **indicates motion direction**:
    - **side of your direction means object goes with me**
    - **opposite side of your direction means object stays behind**

> **optic flow** is the **brain’s cue to calculate position in space**
> 

- brain interprets depth as: **short path is behind long path, therefore there must be depth**
    - **the** **object closest to the eye moves the most because the retinal path is longer**
    - the direction in which an object leaves the visual field indicates the **direction of object motion in the physical world**— this, direction of leaving the visual half-field cues object motion

# pattern recognition

| similarity | items that are **similar** tend to be grouped together |
| --- | --- |
| proximity | objects **near each other** tend to be grouped together  |
| symmetry | **symmetrical images** are perceived collectively, in spite of distance  |
| continuity | lines are seen following the **smoothest path**  |
| closure  | objects **grouped together are seen as a whole**— we tend to ignore gaps and complete lines |
| smallness | smaller areas tend to be seen as **figures against a larger background** |
| surroundedness | areas which are **surrounded by others tend to be seen as independent figures** |
- pattern recognition is NO property of the data (counting frequencies may do just as well)

# reading text

## input: perception

- text is an image with coded meaning
    - three stages of reading:
        1. **visual pattern** perceived
        2. decoded using **internal representation of language**
        3. interpreted using knowledge of **syntax, semantics, and pragmatics**

### decoding and interpretation

| syntactic | language structure, grammar, for instance: |
| --- | --- |
| semantic | the **(non)literal meanings of words and sentences**, regardless of context |
| pragmatic | **meaning with regard to the individuals involved and the context of the situation** |

> **semantics change due to pragmatics** — with time, comments are copied and the underlying code is altered, changing its original meaning
> 

### reading

| scanning | **global exploration** of the text and its structure, effort estimate |
| --- | --- |
| saccades | **eye jumps**, not just into reading direction but back and forth (and some up and down) |
| fixations | **perception and comprehension takes place only during fixations** |

- the less you know as a user (novice), **the more you rely on context**
    - if no context is provided, the dictionary meanings become active
    - like computers, users become error-prone with ambiguities— **semantic priming is the solution**

### ambiguity: one word pointing at more meaning

### synonyms: more words, pointing at one meaning

> know your user groups (novices, experts, other than intended)
labels are short and either self-explicating or should **prime high-frequency meaning** 
yet, avoid ambiguity by not using synonyms
use context clues

|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **contrast**     | - make different things different <br> - bring out dominant elements <br> - mute lesser elements <br> - create dynamism |
| **repetition**   | - repeat design elements throughout <br> - be consistent                       |
| **alignment**    | - visually connect elements <br> - create visual flow                         |
| **proximity**    | - group related elements <br> - separate unrelated ones                       |  


## grids

- horizontal and vertical lines to **locate interface**
- aligns related components

- **organization**
    - contrast for dominant elements
    - element groupings by proximity
    - organizational structure
    - alignment

- **consistency**
    - location
    - format
    - element repetition
    - organization
